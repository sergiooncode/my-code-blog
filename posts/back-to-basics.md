Title: "Back to BASICs"

I few days ago something crossed my mind. It was the very first line of code I ever wrote. The language, BASIC, the year, 1991. At that time I didn't have the remotest idea what I was doing or what 
programming was, but it was new and exciting.

The "weapons" at hand, my new shiny Sinclair ZX Spectrum +2 128K, an old TV set and The Spectrum's User Manual.

I followed one of the exercises in the manual. The code was a combination of two statements, CIRCLE and DRAW.

Basically it drew a circle and an straight line where the CIRCLE statement left the plot position.

It wasn't rocket science, but to me, it was pure and simple magic.
